Nothing in this app is financial advice.

We aim to educate and help young adults make the right financial decisions.

You can choose two sections to explore:
-Savings
-Investments (stocks and crypto).

Try to answer as many questions as possible; there are 12 questions in each section. After every three questions, there is a checkpoint, which means if you answer wrong, you return to that point.

We hope to enjoy this app,good luck.

		<div>
</div>
		<div>Now you are in the right place to start figuring out how to save some money!

Let’s begin! 
</div>
		<div>Did you know that 40% of people aged 22-29 in UK said to have no savings and 10% has between £2,000 - £3,000? Only 25% said to have saved up more than £6,000.

This means that if you have no savings now, it is absolutely OK, and most people are in the same position</div>
		<div>Savings</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>What is the first thing you should do when you would like to start saving money?
</div>
		<div>Pay off your debt</div>
		<div>Get emergency fund</div>
		<div>Budget your money and cut any unnecessary expenses</div>
		<div>Savings - Question 1</div>
		<div>Correct Answer</div>
		<div>Wrong Answer</div>
		<div>Let’s start over...</div>
		<div>Start over...</div>
		<div>When it comes to savings, there are When it comes to savings, there are few steps you need to think about first:

1. Record expenses

– Get to know where your money goes to identify any unnecessary expenses.

2. Include savings on budget

– There are many ways to budget. Excel, apps, websites, paper – find what suits you the best. For example, here is a simple way to budget one’s money
- https://www.unbiased.co.uk/savings-planner.

Make sure to set achievable budget that you can actually stick to.

3. Pay your debt off first
– Before you start saving, it is important to pay off your debt, so pay off your debt first and then start saving up. This however does not include student loan debt as it has different rules. However, if you have some credit card or 'buy now, pay later' outstanding balance that is incurring a lot of interest, that is the debt to focus on.

4. Find ways to cut spendings

– This comes through budgeting. Once you have fully understood where your money goes to, try to cut any unnecessary expenses (or at least try to limit them).

5. Set savings goals
– For you to be able to go through with your budgeting and savings plan, important part is to set clear goal that you're working towards to. If you don't do this, then you will not have a motivation to stick to your plans!

Your goals will also help determine the right ways to save up – different goal, different savings product!

-Short-term goals:
Emergency fund (three to nine months of living expenses), vacation, down payment for a car or a new phone

-Long-term goals: Down payment on a home, your child’s education or retirement

6. Determine financial priorities
– Make sure to always know what your priorities are and review this once in a while – is it to save up for a new house?
Pay of high-interest debt?

7. Pick the right tools (short-term vs long-term) - both short-term and long-term savings have different products out there available that you can use. I.e., instant access savings account is the best for emergency fund. It tends to have very little to no interest, but you can access it any time and have your money immediately. It is good to know which products are the most appropriate for your goal – for example, keeping your emergency funds in basic current account will most likely earn you no to little interest and your savings will loose on its value over time.

8. Make savings automatic
– The minute you receive your income, make it automatic for certain amount to leave for savings immediately. This way it will not feel like you ever had the money and might help you save it.

9. Watch savings grow...
</div>
		<div>How do i start?
</div>
		<div>Should you pay off your student loan prior starting saving money?
</div>
		<div>Yes</div>
		<div>No</div>
		<div>Savings - Question 2</div>
		<div>No. Student loan has different rules, and it is not advised to be repaying it above the minimum repayment requirements as it gets written off after 30 years.

This might be subject to change though, so make sure to check current information regarding your student loan plan!

		<div>Checkpoint!</div>
		<div>Emergency fund
</div>
		<div>What is it?

Emergency fund can prevent you from borrowing money in case you get into financial difficulties and should be 3-6 months’ worth of expenses saved. In case something happens, you know that you have 3-6 months during which you don’t need to worry about income as you will be prepared for it.

 Why is it good?

 You should have an emergency fund before you start saving for anything else or investing. If you get the habit into saving the money on a regular basis and treat it as a non-negotiable expense, you will be in a good position towards financial health.

 What to be cautious about?
 Interest rate – always make sure you check the best interest rate for your savings, do a research and compare

 Tips: Make sure you make a clear plan and identify what is considered as emergency. Use the money only for the emergencies! It can be job loss, medical bills, car or home repair.

 Before allocating your money into a traditional savings account, consider first:

o High-yield savings account – Interest rates can be 20 to 25 times higher than traditional savings accounts. Highest rates are usually offered from online banks. It is easy to link your checking account even with a different bank. When researching high-yield savings accounts, take into consideration initial deposit requirements, interest rates, minimum balance requirements and possible fees.

o Short-term certificate of deposit (CD) - Offers higher interest rates than savings accounts and funds are deposited for a fixed period. It is safer than investing in stocks and bonds, and although it offers lower opportunity for growth, the rate of return is guaranteed.

 o Money market account – They often come with debit cards. Although there might be lower interest rates than high-yield accounts, it benefits by lower restrictions.</div>

		<div>Many people save their money through investments. These are good for long-term savings as they store your money without them losing on value (as you earn interest on your investment, it's higher than with for example ISAs and therefore your money can keep up with inflation**).

However, with savings you are in a chance for higher return, but you are also risking losing all of your money invested.

As investing is a section on its own, for more information see section Investments.

 **Inflation is when there is an increase in the prices of goods and services. This then means that with the money you have you can buy less than you could do before the increase in prices and therefore the money loses value.</div>

		<div>Tax Implications
</div>
		<div>It is important to note that with any savings or investment there comes tax into play.

Each tax year (which in the UK is from 6th April of one year to 5th April of the following year) might have different taxes or allowances so it’s important to always check the current one.

 When you earn interest, it counts towards your income and therefore you can end up paying tax on it.

There are some ways how you will not be paying tax on the interest, and this is important to understand so that you can ensure that you are saving in the most tax-efficient way.

For earning interest, there are three different allowances before you must pay tax on it:

 - Personal allowance:
For the year 2022, the personal allowance is £12,570, meaning one pays tax on everything above that. So, if your income excluding the interest is below that, you can use the rest for any interest earn.

 - Starting rate for savings:
The starting rate for savings is up to £5,000 worth of interest earnt that you don't have to pay tax on. This is however only if you earn below £17,570.
If you earn anything above that, you are not eligible for this starting rate.

Moreover, your starting rate is reduced by any amount that you earn above personal allowance I.e. If you earn £13,600, your starting rate would be reduced by £1,030 (13,600 less 12,570) resulting in rate of £3,970 (5,000 less 1,030).

 - Personal savings allowance:
You get £1,000 tax free if you are a basic rate taxpayer, £500 if you are higher rate taxpayer.

According to government website, the personal savings allowance applies to interests earned from:

• bank and building society accounts
• savings and credit union accounts
• unit trusts, investment trusts and open-ended investment companies
• peer-to-peer lending
• trust funds
• payment protection insurance (PPI)
• government or company bonds
• life annuity payments
• some life insurance contracts Individual savings accounts (ISAs) are then tax-free and therefore don't count towards your savings allowance.</div>

</div>
		<div>31st March
</div>
		<div>Savings - Question 10</div>
		<div>And again...</div>
		<div>Some of the products that are important to be aware of when it comes to savings are Individual Savings Accounts, also known as ISAs.

These are good for your savings or investments and are forever tax-free. However, there is an allowance as to how much you can save across all ISAs you have. The allowance is then tax-free, anything above that is not.

This allowance is always for each tax year (I.e. 6th April – 5th April of the following year).

For tax year 21/22, this allowance is at £20,000. Once you save or invest that, it starts earning interest on it that is tax free.

Next tax year, you can invest the amount within the allowance and earning other interest on it and so on.

 There are five types of ISAs:

 1. Cash ISAs - Cash ISAs are a good standard savings account. You earn interest on it and this interest does not count towards your personal savings allowance. They are risk-free and tax-free.

 There are varieties of Cash ISAs:

 a. Easy-access cash ISAs - These are good for any savings you have you might need access to immediately as there is no penalty for it

 b. Notice cash ISAs - Here you need to get few days' notice to withdraw any cash. So, they are only good if you can wait for the cash.

 c. Fixed rate cash ISAs - These tend to have higher interest rates than easy-access and notice cash ISAs. However, they are at fixed rate. Meaning, you will find for example 2 years fixed rate cash ISAs.

 This means, that you will get penalty if you try to withdraw the cash before the period of 2 years ends. After the agreed time (in our example 2 years), the fixed rate cash ISA will be transferred to easy access cash ISA.

 2. Stocks & Shares ISAs - You can also use the ISA allowance to invest. This is what Stocks & Shares ISA is for. Through this you can invest into bonds, funds and shares in individual companies. It is tax-free investment, but you need to make sure to be aware of potential fees.

Also, know that there is always risk associated with investing and you may lose your money. To learn more about this, see investing section.

 3. Lifetime ISAs - Lifetime ISA is the one for long-term savings. It is there to help with saving for retirement or your first home. There is allowance of up to £4,000 that you can put in each tax year. At the end of the tax year, government will then add to it 25% of the amount you have put in.

Therefore, if you save £4,000, government will add £1,000 to your savings at the end of tax year. - It is important to know that you can open this only between the age 18-39. Once you've opened this, you can only save up to when you're 50.

You can also use this money only once you want to buy your first home or withdraw it for retirement after you're 60. If you withdraw for any other reason, you will pay penalty of 20%, which will result in you losing your bonus.

 - You can save into Cash Lifetime ISA and your money is safe or Stocks and Shares Lifetime ISA, which is again investment and therefore your money are at risk with this one.

 4. Innovative finance ISAs - Through this you can lend money to others and gain tax-free interest. It is essentially peer-to-peer lending.

 - The borrower will pay interest and you will get proportion of it. ISA will take its own cut out of it though, so you will not receive the full interest the borrower paid. The interest, however, is not taxed. You might, however, lose your money if the borrower cannot fully repay it.

 - Withdrawing money might be also a bit more complicated as you need to wait for another investor to buy you out of the loan.

 - As your money is not protected with Innovative finance ISA, you need to know that you might lose your money. 5. Junior ISAs

- This is ISAs for children aged 0-17. It is not relevant to you personally, so we will not go into detail about it, but it is good to know it exists in case you want to open it for your children.</div>
		<div>Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs)
</div>
		<div>There is an allowance on how much you can save/invest across all ISAs you have within the tax-free band.
For this allowance, you need to:</div>
		<div>Know that this is trick question and there is no real allowance for tax-free amount</div>
		<div>Know it's £20,000 a year, every year
</div>
		<div>Know that the allowance is different every tax year and therefore make sure to google 'ISAs allowance for the current year' every time you want to get the up to date information</div>

		<div>You are first property buyer and need as much money for your deposit as possible to be able to get good mortgage. Which ISA is the most suitable for this, given that you want your money to be safe?</div>
		<div>This is the best one as you get 25% bonus on what you've added to the ISA each tax year. So you essentially can be receiving £1,000 a year just for saving towards your deposit!</div>
		<div>Let's finish it...come on...</div>
		<div>Interest Rates</div>
		<div>When you’re saving money with a bank, you are actually lending it to them, so the interest rate (or ‘bank rate’) is the rate a bank pays you for borrowing your money.

Bank of England sets the bank rate for the UK, which influences the interest rate that banks pay on people’s savings.

Any change in the bank rate affects the interest rate on savings and borrowing, so if the rate rises, you can expect to earn a higher interest on your savings.

The current interest rate is 0.75% as of March 2022. This is an increase from last month’s 0.5%. Interest is also called the amount you earn on your savings and as it counts as income, in some cases you are liable for income tax.

However, less than 5% people in the UK can get away with this as they are within the personal savings allowance (PSA). The rates can vary from 0.77% up to 2.2% depending on type of saving. With long term and fixed rates, they tend to be higher, and in short term, with easy withdrawal the rates are lower.

Bottom line: it is more convenient to save either with a fixed rate or in a long term. Let’s look at the main interests and why you should know them.

Compound interest is the core for savings. All it means is that you earn interest on interest, not only on the money you originally saved.

Basically, the longer you save for, the greater the effect of compound interest. This will be very useful for your retirement savings.

Then there is the Annual Equivalent Rate (AER) is the official rate for savings accounts that allows easy comparison between accounts. This represents how much interest you gain in a year if not withdrawn.

Tips: Make sure you check how often you gain the interest when researching for comparison. You can use the following website to calculate the compounding interest:

		<div>Accounts are protected by FCA</div>
		<div>You can explore the below techniques, tips and warnings</div>
		<div>Automate your bills spendings</div>
		<div>The simple way - YouTube</div>
		<div>Different bank, different features</div>
		<div>Round-up function</div>
		<div>Save with another bank</div>
		<div>Don’t let inflation steal your money</div>
		<div>Whenever you're about to open up a new bank account, for example to separate monthly disposable income from your savings or simply that you want to transfer savings to different bank, make sure to ensure that it's FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) protected.

 This means, that if anything happens with the bank i.e., bank is unable to pay you your money, FCA will cover up to £85,000.00 of your finances.

This is for any eligible person as well as per any bank account.</div>
		<div>One of a quick smart way to savings is to allow for the round-up function on your bank.

Most banks introduced this already (e.g., NatWest, Starling) and whenever you pay, the amount paid gets rounded up and the difference between the full number and amount paid goes to savings.

 It's few pennies at times, but when it adds up you can end up saving £10-20 a month.</div>
		<div>Look into splitting your savings and monthly expenses between two different banks.

 This way, you cannot see how much you have saved on a daily basis, and you will not be thinking about how you could spend that.</div>
		<div>Save with other bank</div>
		<div>Do your research on different banks and their features.

For example, Starling has a function called 'spaces'. You can create 'sub-accounts' and into each put money for specific monthly expenses, so that you have that separate and can see how much you have to actually spend.

 Think of it like the envelope method (where people used to put cash into envelopes with each envelope dedicated to something else – bills, rent, takeaway, clothes etc), but in digital form.</div>
		<div>Do your own research into ways how people deal with their savings.

Watch few YouTube videos. This way, you will see whether some of the methods resonates with you and find what's best for you.

 That way you are more likely to stick with it.

And remember – make it as easy and as convenient as possible for you.</div>
		<div>Automate your income split I.e., the minute you receive income into your bank account, automate it in a way that it immediately gets split into appropriate other accounts.

E.g., specific amount of your income gets transferred to your savings account the minute you receive the money.

 This way, you will never feel like you had the money in the first place, and it might be easier for you to save it.</div>
		<div>When it comes to long-term savings, never leave it in your current bank account.

 Make sure to make use of some of the savings products available, as they tend to have interest earned on the savings which helps with trying to keep up at least little bit with the inflation.</div>
		<div>INVESTMENT BASICS</div>
		<div>CRYPTO</div>
		<div>STOCKS & SHAREHOLDINGS</div>
		<div>Choose one section and you can always come back later to explore more!</div>
		<div>Investments – basics Parts of disposable income can also be saved in a way in which it does not lose its value – or where it at least keeps up with inflation.

The best way to do this is via investing. Not only does the money store its value but there is a possibility of increasing your savings.

Investments are something you buy, or something in which you put your money into.

There are 4 main types of investments based on their characteristics. These are called assets classes:

• shares - you buy a stake in a company

• cash – the savings you put in a bank or building society account

• property – you invest in a physical building, whether commercial or residential

• fixed interest securities (also called bonds) - IOUs given in return for loaning money to a company or government.

Additionally, cryptocurrency can be categorized into different assets classes, with some saying it represents its own new asset class.

Investing into various asset classes then means that you as an investor have a portfolio.

Diversifying is then when an investor invests into different asset classes in their portfolio to spread the risk. I.e., if one asset class underperforms, the other will eliminate the 'damage'. Returns are then profits you earn from your investments.

There are multiple ways in which this presents itself:

• dividends (from shares)
• rent (from properties)
• interest (from cash deposits and fixed interest securities)
• the difference between the price you pay and the price you sell for – capital gains or losses.

Investors can pay portfolio managers to handle their investments. However, this costs money and could reduce the overall return one gets on the investment. When investing it is important to assess how risk adverse the investor is. With every investment there is a risk.

The general rule is – the higher the risk, the higher the return or losses. The risk then varies based on the type of investment.

As per MoneyHelper (2021); 'Money you place in secure deposits such as savings accounts risks losing value in real terms (buying power) over time. This is because the interest rate paid won’t always keep up with rising prices (inflation).

On the other hand, index-linked investments that follow the rate of inflation don’t always follow market interest rates. This means that if inflation falls you could earn less in interest than you expected.

Stock market investments are generally expected to beat inflation and interest rates over time, but you run the risk that prices might be low at the time you need to sell. This could result in a poor return or, if prices are lower than when you bought, losing money.'

Based on that, it is good to diversify – i.e., invest into different asset classes. There are many investment products available, such as:

• Stocks
• Bonds
• Municipal Bonds
• Mutual Funds
• Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)
• Annuities
• Certificates of Deposit (CDs)
• Money Market Funds
• Commodities
• Hedge Funds
• Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)
• International Investing

 So when should one invest? There are general rules to follow prior one invests –

i.e. pay off your debt, save to your pension and have instant access to emergency fund (3-6 months in savings).

		<div>Stocks:

We all have financial goals. For some, this may be to achieve a long-term goal, such as living comfortably in retirement.

For others, it may be to save for an important life event, such as buying a home or getting married. Whatever the goal, investing in stocks and shares is a great way to increase your money and can provide you with a higher long-term return than putting money into savings or a current account.

Stocks are a very risky investment. You need to be aware that putting money into these types of investments can result in you losing all your money and ending up with nothing. You also need to know that there are many risks involved in investing in stocks and shares, so it's important to make sure you do your research before making these investments.

Deciding on the timing to buy and sell shares is very difficult and it can be hard to second guess the stock market.

Making regular investments, also called ‘drip-feeding’, can help to smooth out any increases or decreases in the value of different shares. Investing is a way of saving money with the expectation that your money will increase in value over time.

When you invest, you are essentially putting money into assets with the hope that they will appreciate in the future. As the value of your assets appreciates, you will receive a positive return on your investment and generate some income in the process.

Equally, the value of your assets may fall, and you may lose the money you have invested. When investing you should remember to:

Diversify your investments and spread your risk

Understand that greater returns usually come with a greater risk.

Remember you should be investing for at least five years to allow for market ups and downs.

Keep an eye on your portfolio and its performance so you can buy or sell shares if needed.</div>

A stock market is a market where shares or stocks are traded. The stock market is where buyers and sellers meet, and the price of a share is determined by supply and demand.

This can be influenced by economic factors, political events, rumors, and even the weather, but there’s no getting away from the fact that, ultimately, prices are driven by buyers and sellers.
There are two main stock markets in the UK: the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and the Alternative Investment Market (AIM).
The first step in investing in shares is to open an online share trading account with an investment platform. But what you need to know is that you will need to pay some fees to the platform.

The main fees are annual platform, money management, trading and transfer out payments. There may be other fees depending on your investment provider and how you choose to invest.

Market changes and volatility are all part of investing in equities. Therefore, investors should normally consider shares as an investment for at least five years. Holding your entire investment in a company's shares may result in you losing all or part of your money if the company does not perform well. You should consider diversifying your investment into a range of company stocks to help reduce this risk.

What is an ISA?
An ISA is an Individual Savings Account. It’s a special type of account that gives you the opportunity to save or invest a certain amount of money every year, without having to pay tax on any growth in your investments or savings.
Types of ISA
Here’s an overview of the six main types of ISA: cash ISA, stocks and shares ISA, Lifetime ISA, Innovative Finance ISA, Help to Buy ISA and Junior ISA.

The Junior ISA (JISA)
A Junior ISA is a way to start building up savings for children as early as possible. All children resident in the UK can have one. A parent or legal guardian can open it on the child’s behalf; 16-year-olds can open a Junior ISA for themselves.

Anyone, including grandparents, aunts and uncles can add money to a Junior ISA (However, at Nutmeg only the registered contact can contribute.) Once the child turns 18, the Junior ISA automatically converts to an adult ISA.

You can transfer an existing child trust fund (CTF), for which investments are made in cash, into a Junior ISA. As with their adult counterparts, Junior ISAs are tax efficient. You can open a Junior stocks and shares ISA or a Junior cash ISA.

The Junior ISA allowance for the 2021/22 tax year is £9,000.

Applicants must be at least 18 years old and resident in the UK. Proof of identity is required.</div>
		<div>Taxes on investments in shares

When you buy shares, you usually pay a tax or duty of 0.5% on the transaction.
If you buy:
Shares electronically, you’ll pay Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (SDRT).

Shares using a stock transfer form, you’ll pay Stamp Duty if the transaction is over £1,000.

You’ll have to pay tax at 1.5% if you transfer shares into some ‘depositary receipt schemes’ or ‘clearance services.

You pay tax when you buy:
-Existing shares in a company incorporated in the UK

-An option to buy shares
-An interest in shares, for example

-An interest in the money from selling them
-Shares in a foreign company that has a share register in the UK.

-Rights arising from shares,
for example rights you have when new shares are issued

When you do not pay tax
You do not have to pay tax if you:

-are given shares for nothing
-subscribe to a new issue of shares in a company
-buy shares in an ‘open ended investment company’ (OEIC) from the fund manager
-buy units in a unit trust from the fund manager

		<div>What you should know before making a share investment decision?

Trading in shares can be an excellent way to make a return on your money but is less rewarding if you're paying through the nose for someone to make that trade for you. These questions will walk you through the fundamentals of what shares are and what you should know before investing.
Shareholdings
What is a share?

The purpose of issuing business shares is to raise capital, and consumers acquire shares in firms because they believe the company will prosper and want to be a part of it.

In its most basic form, an equity share is a division of the value of a corporation.
For example, if a business has a market capitalisation of £100 million and has 50 million shares, each share has a value of £2 (usually listed as 200p).
Those shares can go up and down in weight for various reasons.

		<div>Shares - Question 6</div>
		<div>No, I don't understand shares yet
</div>
		<div>Yes, I understood and want to learn about shares</div>
		<div>Share trading is about a stock exchange or over-the-counter (OTC) market, where investors may buy and sell shares and other assets in return for a fee or commission.
Do you know anything about shares?
</div>
		<div>What Is a Shareholder?

Investment returns are determined mainly by whether or not the company in which you buy stock succeeds or fails. As a result of purchasing an investment in a corporation, you are essentially becoming a part-owner of that corporation.

As a shareholder, the person who buys a share in a firm, they effectively become a part-owner of that company and shareholder with an equity position in that firm.

Shareholder dividends are paid by companies, although some companies opt to reinvest earnings to develop faster.

The right of Shareholders
Shareholders have the right to see the company's books and records, the authority to sue the business for the actions of its directors or officials, and the ability to vote on critical corporate affairs such as the appointment of board directors.

On top of all of this, shareholders have the power to accept or disapprove of merger proposals; they can also earn dividends; they may attend annual meetings, and they can cast a vote on crucial subjects through proxy.

It is important to know that all of the above is dependent on what type of shares you have and how many shares you have so it is always good to check before investing!

		<div>What might your rights be as a shareholder?
</div>
		<div>The right to vote on critical corporate matters</div>
		<div>And over again...</div>
		<div>Investing may bring in profits in one of two ways. One is if the value of the shares rises, resulting in a gain on the sale of the shares.

The other question is whether or not they generate profits for their shareholders. Like interest on a savings account, dividends may be compared to rewards. If a firm develops a profit, it may donate part of it back to you — either regularly or as a one-off.

Benefits of investing in shares

-Part-ownership of a company
-Real-time dealing throughout the trading day with limit orders available when markets are closed
-Receive dividends either as income or reinvest to buy more shares
-Ability to vote on important company decisions
Dangers:
Be aware of scam callers ”cold callers” who are trying to sell “shares or stocks” in cheaper prices.

</div>
		<div>This is a personal decision, as only you will know whether you're willing to risk some of your cash, and if so, how much.

So, what are the points to keep in mind when investing in stocks?</div>
		<div>You should invest for long term, at least five years.</div>
		<div>The market is unpredictable regularly invest in smoothing out ups and downs.</div>
		<div>Watch out for scams, never buy shares from a cold caller and diversify.</div>
		<div>Shares - Question 8</div>
		<div>What to consider when choosing stocks and shares?

To successfully develop your share portfolio frequently involves study and thought. Before investing in stocks, consider the following:

- Before investing in stocks, be sure you have a diverse portfolio of other assets.

- Examine the company's balance sheet and income statement using the investment factsheets.

Follow corporate regulatory news service (RNS) feeds and announcements.

- Financial statements and factsheets are accessible online.

- Have you taken advantage of any tax-efficient allowances by creating Stocks and Shares first?
</div>
		<div>Do your research
</div>
		<div>Diversification, check the facts and tax-efficient allowances.
</div>
		<div>Shares - Question 9</div>
		<div>Which from the bellow, is the main thing to keep in mind when choosing stocks and shares?
</div>
		<div>Confirm the validity of a share</div>
		<div>The value per share
</div>
		<div>Basic rules of share investing:

Although investing in individual shares is hazardous, there are some fundamental guidelines worth following if you're looking to add certain firms to your portfolio that you feel have the potential to be profitable.

What you’ll learn:

-Why it’s important to do plenty of research before you buy.

-Why investing in individual shares is a risky approach.

-Why diversification matters.

On the other hand, it may be helpful to investors in determining where they should put their money and how they can minimise their risks when making share purchase decisions.
</div>
		<div>Shares - Question 10</div>
		<div>Whatever steps you take to reduce risk, shares can be volatile, and their values can fall as quickly as they arise, so you could get back less than you put in.
 -Do plenty of research before buying
-Don’t invest in anything you don’t understand
-Understand the differences between small and large companies -

Be patient: Successful investing is often about 'time in the market' and not 'timing the market'.
-Keep emotions out of your investment decisions
-Spread your risk

 Do you want to invest based on these rules?</div>
		<div>Yes, I want to invest based on the above investment rule.</div>
		<div>I wouldn't mind the above rule.
</div>
		<div>No, I can invest in an exchange, and there are no rules.</div>
		<div>Nearly there...</div>
		<div>The risks of investing in shares

Your assets may become excessively concentrated on a single business, type of product, or industry; thus, it is essential to maintain a varied portfolio.
Because it is not actively managed by a professional, you will be responsible for managing your portfolio yourself.

You may also be required to spend more time analysing your investment to understand the elements influencing it.

If the firm underperforms or the market conspires against you, the value of your shares might plummet, resulting in a return that is less than what you initially put in.
The risks of investing in share
-The Risk of Capital Loss and volatility risk
-Market risk, timing risk and exchange rate risk
-Sector Specific Risk and stock-specific risk

		<div>Final Question!</div>
		<div>No, financial advisor ‘s advice is not helpful.
</div>
		<div>Yes, I should have a financial advisor</div>
		<div>This material is not intended to be personal advice for any specific type of financial investment. However, if you are unsure about the appropriateness of an asset, should you visit an authorised financial advisor?
</div>
		<div>Correct answer!
Section completed!
Well done!
</div>
		<div>Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies created using blockchain technology. They use high encryption to secure the blockchain network.

The vast majority of crypto is decentralised and all the transactions are peer to peer.
The first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 and is the most valuable cryptocurrency in market cap (market capital). The current crypto coins/tokens number is more than 19,000.

Their adoption can only be compared with the Internet’s adoption. It is estimated that the current number of crypto holders is 300,000,000 worldwide, and this number is fast rising.</div>
		<div>Cryptocurrencies</div>
		<div>Crypto - Question 1</div>
		<div>Cryptocurrencies and blockchain is a new, fast-rising technology; it is considered by many as revolutionary.

Is crypto decentralised?
</div>
		<div>Start over

</div>
		<div>Who is the creator of Bitcoin?
</div>
		<div>Natoshi Sakamoto</div>
		<div>Elon Musk</div>
		<div>Crypto - Question 2</div>
		<div>Satoshi Nakamoto</div>
		<div>Benefits and drawbacks</div>
		<div>
One of the most important benefits of this technology is that network’s security is at the highest standards possible.

There are no intermediaries, banks or brokers; all the transactions are peer to peer, the transaction cost is low or in many occasions 0%, and everything is decentralised.

There is no need for a bank account; you only need to have a digital wallet where you can store your coins, unless if you choose to use a centralised exchange.

As a drawback, we can mention that if you lose your wallet’s password, there is no way to recover it. Another drawback is the colossal energy consumption that some cryptocurrencies use to secure their network, one of them is Bitcoin.

Additionaly, the transactions usually take some minutes before the network can validate them.

Illegal transactions have often been spotted because of the anonymity and decentralisation of cryptocurrencies and blockchain.
</div>
		<div>Blockchain and cryptocurrencies offer decentralisation and anonymity of transactions.
Is a bank account required?
</div>
		<div>No,it’s not necessary</div>
		<div>For centralised exchanges yes, for decentralised no.</div>
		<div>Yes,it is required</div>
		<div>Crypto - Question 3</div>
		<div>Crypto - Question 4</div>
		<div>No, usually it takes some minutes to complete.</div>
		<div>Usually, it takes hours
</div>
		<div>Yes, all the transactions are instant.
</div>
		<div>On the blockchain network, are the transactions instant?
</div>
		<div>Many new retail investors prefer centralised exchanges because they are easier to use.

They have real-time access to all the required information regarding the cryptocurrencies they want, and they can trade in real-time.

However, you own the coins when the digital keys are only yours,and the keys are only yours when you don’t use centralised exchanges.

Therefore, the personal digital wallet might be a better option.</div>
		<div>Retail Investors</div>
		<div>Crypto - Question 5</div>
		<div>Where will you invest when you want instant transactions?
</div>
		<div>Both</div>
		<div>Centralised exchanges</div>
		<div>Decentralised exchanges</div>
		<div>What is the main disadvantage of centralised exchanges?
</div>
		<div>It can be hacked</div>
		<div>Hard to use</div>
		<div>Crypto - Question 6</div>
		<div>Real-time transactions</div>
		<div>The crypto market is very different compared to the traditional stock market. It has many benefits and many risks.

First things first, all cryptocurrencies are not the same. There are 18.000 cryptos to choose from. The largest and oldest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is considered a store of value, good enough to use as a medium of exchange.

In 2021, Bitcoin’s price was increased by 59%, while some other cryptocurrencies were increased in value by 12,000%.

In contrast, the traditional stocks gains in a year are considered extremely good if they are more than 20%.

Also, inflation’s impact on Bitcoin is minimum. Bitcoin’s impact on the market is immense and is the cornerstone of the entire crypto market; if Bitcoin’s price increases, the whole market will increase.

The market can offer massive gains and massive losses in just some hours.

The volatility (which is how quickly the prices will go up or down), in many cases, is considered very high or extreme.

Another factor to be aware of is that the market is prone to manipulation, not Bitcoin so easily, but other cryptocurrencies.
</div>
		<div>Crypto Market</div>
		<div>The crypto space is exciting for someone who believes in technology and thinks out of the box. It challenges old perceptions and can offer potentially massive gains or losses. Bitcoin’s price in 2009 was less than $20, while nowadays, it is $40,000 per coin.
Is Bitcoin the only good reason to invest in the market?
</div>
		<div>Yes, Bitcoin is the best reason to invest in the market.</div>
		<div>No, some other cryptocurrencies are also very valuable.
</div>
		<div>Crypto - Question 7</div>
		<div>Bitcoin is one good reason, but it's not the only reason.
</div>
		<div>And again...

</div>
		<div>Yes,it has</div>
		<div>No, it hasn’t
</div>
		<div>Crypto - Question 8</div>
		<div>Yes, apart from Bitcoin and very few other cryptos
</div>
		<div>Has inflation significant impact on the crypto market?
</div>
		<div>Timing the market</div>
		<div>Timing, the right time to invest in the crypto market, is one of the most challenging things, even the most experienced traders cannot do it successfully. However, some common factors can indicate where the market might go.

One of the essential factors is Bitcoin’s halving, which occurs every four years. This event is when the Bitcoin miners profits are reduced in half, triggering a massive bull run(when all the prices increase) in the market, which lasts approximately a year.

As result, the prices skyrocket. The previous Bitcoin halving event was in 2020, and the next event is in 2024.

Another factor to keep an eye is further crypto adoption by some countries. A typical example is El Salvador, where nowdays Bitcoin is a legal tender, or adoption by major companies like Tesla in the past and PayPal.

Another good indicator to invest in the market is when everything goes down; it probably is perfect timing to invest. Also known, as “buy the dip”.

Before someone invests, the most critical factor is knowing where
she/he invests, why, how long,and long term or short term. If an investor doesn’t have a plan and a specific strategy, this is a perfect way to have hard times potentially.

Buying when the prices are high, and selling when the prices are low, lacking a specific strategy and goals, are some typical examples of what a retail investor should avoid.

Also, never act impulsively and don’t look at the prices constantly.
</div>
		<div>The crypto market is highly volatile, and it’s nearly impossible to time the market; we can have only some indications of where the market will go in the long run.
When is the best time to invest in the market for a better chance to have profits?
</div>
		<div>Crypto - Question 9</div>
		<div>Before the Bitcoin halving event</div>
		<div>When everything is up, it will go up even higher.</div>
		<div>During the bear market (when all prices are low).</div>
		<div>Last checkpoint!</div>
		<div>Crypto - Question 10</div>
		<div>Selling when a crypto has significant gains.</div>
		<div>Buying when a crypto is already in huge profits.</div>
		<div>Never selling</div>
		<div>What is the most common mistake new retail investors are doing when entering the market?</div>
		<div>Nearly there...
</div>
		<div>In 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, published the Bitcoin’s whitepaper, Bitcoin then was the only cryptocurrency.

In 2022 there are more than 18,000 cryptocurrencies. Some of them have a specific use some are meme-coins without any specific use case or any underlying technology.

The estimated number of crypto holders currently is 300,000,000, and it is estimated that this number will be 1 billion crypto holders by 2027.

Its adoption rate is monumental and can be compared only with the internet’s early adoption numbers.
The reasons for this adoption are not only the cryptocurrencies but mainly the underlying technology they have.

Apart from Bitcoin, Ethereum, the second most important crypto and second in market capital, has developed a vast ecosystem using new technologies, such as decentralised finance (defi) and NFTs.

However, Ethereum has the most competitors who are trying to take advantage of it’s high cost transaction fees (gas fees) and it’s average transaction speed.

Some other cryptocurrencies are trying to fill some other gaps, trying to have faster networks, cheaper transactions, and trying to provide the investors with alternative ecosystems.

Not everything was easy, though; China decided in 2021 to ban every crypto transaction and mining. As a result, the Bitcoin miners left the country and resided in various countries, primarily the US.

This had a short-term impact on Bitcoin’s adoption, but not in the medium term. In contrast, El Salvador adopted Bitcoin as a legal tender and boosted the crypto industry even further.</div>
		<div>Crypto adoption</div>
		<div>According to the latest stats, cryptocurrency's adoption is skyrocketing, even with some drawbacks, like China’s ban on Bitcoin that didn’t prevent the further expansion of the crypto and blockchain technology.
What is the most important reason behind this trend?
</div>
		<div>Crypto - Question 11</div>
		<div>Bitcoin is the only reason</div>
		<div>The underlying technology that most cryptocurrencies have</div>
		<div>Meme coins</div>
		<div>Crypto - Final question</div>
		<div>Because it is the second in market cap, behind Bitcoin.</div>
		<div>Because of its massive ecosystem built around it.</div>
		<div>Why is Ethereum considered the second most important crypto asset nowadays?</div>
		<div>Start over (again)
